  # [SitePrism::DSL]
  #
  # This is the core internal workings of SitePrism. It consists of four moving parts - plus some generic methods included here
  #   Builder -> The way in which the .build method generates lots of instance-methods on a SitePrism::Page or SitePrism::Section instance
  #   Methods -> The public DSL metaprogram methods, such as `element` or `section`
  #   Locators -> Our locator scoping logic within capybara. By and large leaning on `#to_capybara_node`
  #   Validators -> EXPERIMENTAL: A new module that ensures names of all DSL items conform to certain rules
  #
